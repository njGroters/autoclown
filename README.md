# Autoclown ü§°

Automated solver (agent?) for the Juice Fountain clown minigames in [Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/738060/Freddy_Fazbears_Pizzeria_Simulator/)

Sends a spacebar keypress when the left and right sides of the screen are clear of children. Rewritten in Rust after the first version (C#, Windows Form) proved to be too slow at sending the input

Built for use on Windows 10 with a 1920 x 1080 screensize. Your mileage outside of that scope may vary.
